        <p class="hero-lead">
          Many cards advertise “included insurance” or “extra protection”. This page explains what that usually means in practice — from purchase protection and travel policies to chargeback rights and exclusions.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Are Card-Based Protections?</h2>
      <p>Card-based protections are benefits attached to your card agreement or a linked insurance policy. They can include purchase protection, extended warranty, travel insurance, rental-car coverage and dispute rights against merchants.</p>
      <p>These protections do not replace local consumer laws. Instead, they sit on top as additional layers defined by the issuer, the network and third-party insurers. The scope, limits and exclusions vary significantly between products.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Mechanics -->
    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Protections Are Activated</h2>
      <p>Protections are usually conditional. In many cases, you need to pay for the trip, product or rental with the card in order for coverage to apply. Other times, benefits are always-on as long as the card account is in good standing.</p>
      <p>In practice, activation can depend on:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Which part of the purchase was paid with the card</li>
        <li>Whether the cardholder is the named traveler or renter</li>
        <li>Booking location and residence of the cardholder</li>
        <li>Compliance with any pre-trip requirements (for example booking windows)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The details are set out in the policy wording and card terms, not in short marketing summaries.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Purchase Protection &amp; Extended Warranty</h2>
      <p>Purchase protection typically covers theft or accidental damage to eligible items for a limited time after purchase. Extended warranty may prolong the manufacturer’s warranty for certain categories of goods.</p>
      <p>These protections normally have:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Coverage limits per item and per year</li>
        <li>Clear exclusions (for example used items, commercial use, certain product types)</li>
        <li>Specific documentation requirements when making a claim</li>
      </ul>
      <p>They are designed to complement, not replace, statutory consumer rights in your jurisdiction.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Travel Insurance &amp; Rental-Car Coverage</h2>
      <p>Many travel-oriented cards bundle some form of travel insurance or rental-car coverage. This can include medical coverage, trip delay or cancellation, lost baggage and collision damage waiver for car rentals.</p>
      <p>However, coverage is often subject to:</p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>Maximum trip length and distance from home</li>
        <li>Age limits, activity exclusions and health conditions</li>
        <li>Requirements to decline the rental agency’s own damage waiver</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Reading the policy documents is essential to understand what is and is not protected on a given trip.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Chargebacks, Disputes and Consumer Rights</h2>
      <p>Beyond insurance-style benefits, cards also provide dispute mechanisms such as chargebacks, governed by network rules. These allow you to contest certain transactions when goods are not delivered, are defective or charges are unauthorized.</p>
      <p>Chargeback rights have strict time limits, evidentiary requirements and reason codes. They are not a guarantee of reversal, but an additional tool alongside local consumer protection laws and direct communication with merchants.</p>
